## Sensor Generation Summary

| Generation | Cameras | Film Simulations | Notable Features |
|------------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **X-Trans I** | 5 cameras | 5 simulations | Original X-Trans, core set only |
| **X-Trans II** | 8 cameras | 8 simulations | Added Classic Chrome, PRO Neg |
| **X-Trans III** | 7 cameras | 12-13 simulations | Added Acros variants, Eterna (X-H1) |
| **X-Trans IV** | 9 cameras | 14-15 simulations | Classic Neg, Bleach Bypass, Color Chrome FX Blue |
| **X-Trans V** | 9 cameras | 17 simulations | Nostalgic Neg, Reala Ace, all features |
| **Bayer APS-C** | 9 cameras | 6-8 simulations | Entry-level, limited set |
| **GFX Medium** | 10 cameras | 12-17 simulations | Follows X-Series progression |
| **Bayer 1"** | 1 camera | 5 simulations | Compact, curated selection |

## Key Notes

1. **X-Trans I cameras** (2011-2013) have only the core 5 film simulations
2. **X-Trans II cameras** (2013-2016) added Classic Chrome and PRO Neg modes
3. **X-Trans III cameras** (2016-2018) added Acros with filter variants
4. **X-H1** was the first to get Eterna (cinematic simulation)
5. **X-Trans IV cameras** split into two groups:
   - Early (X-T3, X-T30): 14 simulations
   - Late (X100V, X-Pro3, X-T4): 15 simulations (added Bleach Bypass)
6. **X-Trans V cameras** (2022+) get all 17 simulations including Nostalgic Neg and Reala Ace
7. **GFX cameras** follow similar progression to X-Series
8. **Bayer sensor cameras** have limited film simulation sets

## Firmware Updates

Some cameras received film simulations via firmware updates:
- **X-T3/X-T30**: Classic Negative added via firmware (initially didn't have it)
- **X-H1**: First to receive Eterna (2018)

## Usage in Recipes

When creating recipes:
- Always check camera compatibility using the `camera_film_sims` table
- Filter recipes by sensor generation for cross-compatibility
- X-Trans V recipes work on all X-Trans V cameras
- X-Trans IV recipes may need tweaking for X-Trans III cameras
- Bayer recipes have limited cross-compatibility
